When choosing a reward, you get 5 choices from a specific category. The choices prioritise cards you currently don't own.

This tool will autofill cards you don't own for each category to display your options. With less than 5 remaining options, you can guarantee choosing any missing card from that category.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run deploy`

### `npm start`
